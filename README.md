# VBA-Challenge

This code is meant to get various information from yearly stock data and get the most extreme values for each year.
If a new year must be added, add it into a new sheet wit the same format as the other years.
Empty and 0 value based tickets will not cause the code to break.

Avoid doing things in the script work areas or the work will be overriden with the script.
If you must have work in the worksheet, begin your work on Cell O6.
